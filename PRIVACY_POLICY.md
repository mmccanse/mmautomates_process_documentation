- Videos are not retained on servers after processing completes
- This prototype is hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud
- For enterprise use, this can be deployed on internal company servers for enhanced security

### Data Processing Pipeline

When you upload a video file, the following data processing occurs:

1. **Video Upload**: Your video file is temporarily stored on our servers
2. **Audio Extraction**: The audio track is extracted from your video
3. **Audio Transcription**: Audio is sent to Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro API for transcription
4. **Analysis**: The transcript is analyzed by Gemini to identify key moments for screenshots
5. **Frame Extraction**: Video frames are extracted at identified timestamps
6. **Documentation Generation**: Transcript and screenshots are sent to Gemini to generate documentation
7. **File Creation**: A Word document is created with your generated documentation
8. **Cleanup**: All temporary files are deleted immediately after processing
